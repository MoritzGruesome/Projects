This was a personal project that I took on. The goal of this project was to successfully train a neural network on the MNIST database 
for hand-written digits. 

I built everything from the ground up, including the structure of the neural network, feedforward mechanisms, backpropagation algorithm
and dataset formatting. This was done with the guidance of a book written by Michael Nielson on Neural Networks and Deep Learning. 

In order to run the code for yourself, you can simply navigate to the main.py file and run. You can change parameters like learnign rate, number 
of epochs and batch size, in the arguments of the learning function.

Note: Due to the size of the dataset, it may take 30 seconds to a minute, to load the dataset when running the code.
