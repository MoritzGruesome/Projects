This was an assignment I completed for my Algorithms and Data structures course at KTH. The code was written in Java.

This is my implementation of a path solving program, using Dijkstras Algorithm. This was implemented using a queue, Hash table and of course the algorithm itself.

You can try out the code my going to ./src/bench and entering any two european cities as shown.
